# ps-rest-fundamentals
Assets for my Pluralsight course, REST Fundamentals (2020 revision)

## General
The original course launched in the spring of 2012 and even today is useful in helping folks understand the theory behind the REST architectural style. A few things that I want to improve in this refresh include the following.

* do a better job bridging the theoretical to the practical by adding a reference implementation to each major conceptual topic
* drive home the point that REST describes a complete system architecture and not just the server
* address some of the [typically practical] questions that have come up since I first recorded the course
* include commentary on my own experience in the last 8 years as an implementer of these ideas
* introduce some of the principles of linked data as a natural progression of REST

## Outline
1. Introduction
2. RESTful architecture by comparison
3. Elements of REST

_in general, I'm not super happy with this outline yet (though it follows the original version of the course). Want to explore a strategy of mixing in the practicum with the conceptual more._
